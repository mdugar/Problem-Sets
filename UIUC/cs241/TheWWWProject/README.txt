Use the makefile to make the two programs 'filelist' and 'webserver'

filelist:
Help - my filelisting program has several bugs! It should list all files in a directory.
However - it does not recurse properly and it does not handle symbolic links correctly.
I don't want symlinks to directories or files to be followed; I just want to know what they point to.
Please fix it!

webserver:
Please finish my webserver.
When it is working, you will have a webserver that can serve html files and images.
For a test website, I've included Tim Berners-Lee's original code, announcement and screenshot of his working WWW project.
