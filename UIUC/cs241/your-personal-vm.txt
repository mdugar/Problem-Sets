Hi nunni2, your personal VM is ready for you at sp15-cs241-137.cs.illinois.edu
Example use: ssh nunni2@sp15-cs241-137.cs.illinois.edu
Once logged in, you can use "sudo" to run a command as root
The password for root and nunni2 account is the same and is NOT linked to your netid/AD account info.
By tomorrow I will email you your password.
You can change your account password using the passwd command.
Note this VM wil likely be deleted without notice at the end of the semester. But in the meantime - have fun!
 - Lawrence
