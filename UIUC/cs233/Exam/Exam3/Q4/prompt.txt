In question_4.s, you will find a function to implement
(with the source commented at the top). Place all of your code in this file.
Only this file will be graded (we will use our own main.s to test your code).

To test your implementation, we have provided a set of test cases in main.s.
The instructions to run these tests are at the top of question_4.s.

output.txt contains the correct output for the test cases.

If you wish to run the source directly, we have provided the same test cases
in main.cpp. Read the top of main.cpp file for compilation instructions.

Since the provided test cases are not necessarily comprehensive, you may want to
add your own test cases. If you choose to add more test cases, add them to main.s.
Do not add them to question_4.s!
