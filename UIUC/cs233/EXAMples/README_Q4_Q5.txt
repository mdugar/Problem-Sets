The format of Q4 and Q5 is identical.  In both cases, we'll give you a 
single C function that you are supposed to translate.  You only need to
edit the question_4.s and question_5.s files and test them using the
commands at the top of those files.  We even provide the expected output.

The generic instructions in the Q*/prompt.txt file will be provided on 
the exam.
