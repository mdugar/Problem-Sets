    "### How does a GPS chip determine where it is located?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore what a GPS chip does: we'll build up a simple model, and then let you pretend to be the GPS chip.\n",

    "<img src=\"http://i59.tinypic.com/2n69hz7.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We first assume that we have obtained the $N$ GPS signals, each of which gives a noisy measurement of the distance between the GPS satellite and the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noisy measurements are modeled as follows, where $n_i$ is iid Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2$. $$D_i = d_i + n_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation, $d_i$ is the actual distance to the $i$-th satellite, and $D_i$ is the reported distance, which is corrupted by additive noise $n_i$. This additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) channel model is actually very common in information theory, and can be analyzed just like how we analyzed the BEC and BSC earlier in the course! It is a pretty good model for satellite communication links as you don't have to deal with shadowing, multipath, excessive interference, etc. (come talk to one of us if you're interested in learning more about this stuff/what it means!)\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, let's visualize the entire space as a 2D plane. Assume that all GPS satellites and the object to be located (GPS chip) are on the plane. Denote the position of the unknown object as $(x, y)$, and let $(x_i, y_i)$ be the position of the $i$th GPS satellite.\n"

    "Yesterday night between 11:03 p.m. and 11:44 p.m. the BLISS Lab was burglarized. The elapsed time for entry, theft and exit from the building was approximately 6 minutes. To prevent thefts from occurring inside or nearby Cory Hall and Soda Hall please remember to:\n",
    "- Be AWARE of your surroundings; Be aware;\n",

    "Indeed, the hidden secret of EE126 is stolen from Kangwook’s desk in the BLISS lab. The note has been secretly shared among teaching staffs at Berkeley for more than 50 years, and has been secret sauce of EE126. \n",

    "Fortunately, the UCPD promptly reacted and caught the suspect, but the suspect didn’t possess the note; he claims that he lost it while escaping. We believe that he must have dropped the note at $(x_0, y_0)$, where he started running at a constant velocity $(v_x, v_y)$ for $99$ minutes until he reached $(x_{99}, y_{99}) = (x_0,y_0) + 99(v_x, v_y)$. We found that the GPS sensor in his iPhone has collected distance measurements from $5$ GPS towers in the SF bay area for $99$ minutes. The GPS towers are located as described in the following figure.\n",

If you think that you found the location of the secret, please check out the location. Whoever finds the ‘secret notes’ and return the notes without opening it will be awarded 1% bonus to his/her final grade. If you physically find the note, please make a post on Piazza declaring your victory ~~to gloat~~ so other teams know not to go searching.\n",

    "GPS receivers make use of the fact that light propagates at a known speed, so the receiver can compute distances from the satellites by measuring how long it takes the GPS signal to propagate from the satellite to the receiver.\n",
    "This requires very accurate time measurements — light in free space travels 300m in a microsecond, so small timing errors result in huge distance errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first section of the lab will be to determine how a GPS chip actually goes about receiving and decoding signals. We will step through a subset of problems that must be combatted to successfully send signals from a satellite to your GPS chip. The second portion of the lab will then explore how a GPS chip can use the data it receives to determine its location, assuming the raw, received signals were acquired and decoded. We end with a little open-ended challenge for you. Hope you have fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does a GPS chip decode received signals?\n",

    "The first signal a GPS receiver attempts to find is the Coarse/Acquisition signal. This contains a 1500 bit chunk of data called the \"almanac.\" It contains information and status concerning all the satellites (locations and status) agreed upon by all satellites and is valid for approximately 180 days.\n",
    "This signal is sent at a very low data rate and is intended only to give the receiver a rough idea of the time/location before moving on to the higher data rate, more precise signals. In this lab, we will only focus on the almanac being modulated over the C/A signal.\n",

Each satellite transmits with a unique PRN that will not correlate with any other satellite's code (the codes orthogonal to one another, and will \"cancel each other out\" when xor'd together). This is a form of \"Code Division Multiple Access,\" (CDMA) where multiple transmitters can send messages over a single channel without risk of collision. As long as each PRN is orthogonal to the rest, each data signal can be independently recovered. \n",

    "However, according to general relativity, objects under the influence of relatively weaker gravitational fields experience time *faster* than those under stronger gravitational fields, according to $T_{sat} = \\frac{T_{Earth}}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2GM}{Rc^2}}}$.  Given that these satellites are $20,000km$ above the Earth and that they experience approximately one-fourth the gravity as we do on Earth, the resulting rate at which time passes faster for the satellites is $45 \\mu s$ per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have that the net change in the amount of time satellites experience relative to us on Earth is $45 \\mu s - 7 \\mu s = \\boxed{+38 \\mu s / day}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that a $50ns$ error in keeping time corresponded to a distance error of $15m$, a $38\\mu s$ error in keeping time corresponds to an error in location of more than $11km$.  Even crazier is that this is the amount of error in location that builds up *per day*!  Without taking relativity into consideration, GPS devices would be rendered useless within 2 minutes of being synchronized with the satellites' atomic clocks.\n",
