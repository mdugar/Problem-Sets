    "Alice and Bob are working together to bake some treats.\n",
    "Alice is in charge of sending Bob the recipe, and Bob is responsible for following directions.\n",
    "Bob is *extremely* literal- if an error in the recipe says to use 2000 eggs instead of 2, he will use 2000 eggs without a second thought.\n",
    "Alice is aware of Bob's lack of common sense, but she is also busy.\n",
    "She already has the recipe open on her phone, so she wants to send it via email (using wifi) to Bob.\n",
    "Unfortunately, Alice's evil next-door-neighboor Eve has her microwave running continuously at maximum power.\n",
    "Microwaves emit a lot of radiation around wifi's 2.4GHz channels, causing interference.\n",

    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that Alice's message is $N$ bits long with each bit iid Bernoulli(0.5).\n",
    "We model the channel as a [binary symmetric channel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_symmetric_channel), as shown below.\n",
    "Each bit sent through the channel is flipped (independently) with probability p.\n",
    "We'll assume p=0.05, which is a fairly typical value for wireless communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Binary_symmetric_channel_%28en%29.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that Alice and Bob use some sort of message integrity check in their message (like a [CRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check)) - to keep things simple, let's assume Bob can detect any error with probability 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assume that Bob sends Alice an ACK or NACK and assume that this message always succeeds.\n",
    "If Bob sends an ACK, Alice knows Bob got the message.\n",
    "If Bob sends a NACK, Alice tries to send again."

    "## Convolutional Coding\n",
    "It should make intuitive sense that we can get to low probabilities of error if we increase the number of repetitions.\n",
    "However, increasing the number of repetitions lowers Alice's effective datarate.\n",
    "Alice's phone also has limited battery life, and sending lots of repetitions consumes a lot of energy.\n",
    "Is it possible to correct a lot of errors without having to send so many extra bits? \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! The 802.11 standards for wifi use convolutional codes and LDPC codes to correct errors.\n",
    "Convolutional codes can be efficiently decoded using the Viterbi algorithm, so they will be the focus of this lab.\n",
    "<img src=\"http://imgur.com/BzlsY89.png\" width=\"500px\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above picture is a block diagram for a simple convolutional encoder.\n",
    "The input message is treated as a stream of bits \n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_0, d_1, d_2, d_3 \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is shifted through a series of delays - at time k, the input is $d_k$, the first delay element (the \"D\" on the left) contains $d_{k-1}$, and the last delay elements (the \"D\" on the right) contains $d_{k-2}$.\n",
    "In this example, each input bit produces two output bits - the first output computed by the top \"adder\" and the second output computed by the bottom \"adder\". We denote the output of the top adder as $u_k$ and the bottom adder as $v_k$. The equations for each are given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "u_k &= d_k + d_{k-2} &\\text{mod } 2\\\\\n",
    "v_k &= d_k + d_{k-1} + d_{k-2} &\\text{mod } 2\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We further define $d_{-2}= d_{-1}=0$ for initalization of the algorithm. The two outputs are interleaved into one bitstream so the output is $(u_0, v_0, u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, ...)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to note is that this is not actually all that different from repetition coding.\n",
    "Like repetition coding, we are adding redundancy by generating multiple output bits per input bit.\n",
    "However, unlike repetition coding, convolutional codes have *memory*.\n",
    "Each output bit is a function of multiple input bits.\n",
    "The idea is that if there is an error, you should be able to use the surrounding bit estimates to help you figure out what was actually sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the state transition diagram corresponding to the example encoder above.\n",
    "Each transition is labelled $d_k/(u_k, v_k)$.\n",
    "The two bits inside the circle correspond to the *state*. In order to compute the next output we must have $d_{k-2},d_{k-1}$ so we represent our state to as two numbers $d_{k-2}d_{k-1}$ (of which there are 4 different combinations). \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the state $10$ and the transition $1/00$. We first identify $d_{k-2} = 1$ and $d_{k-1}=0$ from the state. From the transition information we identify $d_k = 1$, $u_k = 0$, and $v_k = 0$ (note that $u_k$ and $v_k$ need not be given as they are entirely determined by the other three variables). The new state is then $d_{k-1}d_k = 10$ which is consistent with the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to convince yourself that the encoder above is equivalent to the state transition diagram below.\n",

    "<img src=\"http://imgur.com/W9fSfpn.png\" width=\"300px\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "This finite state machine (FSM) diagram uses the following convention: the bit left of the slash represents the input, while the bits right to the slash represent the output pair $(u,v)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that the input bits are iid Bernoulli(0.5), this is a Markov chain with every state equally likely.\n",
    "We can run the Viterbi algorithm on our output bits (even after going through a noisy channel) to recover a good estimate of the input bits.\n",
