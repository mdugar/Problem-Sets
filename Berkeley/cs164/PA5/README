Write-up for PA5
----------------
This assignment is 22 hours late. I had 73 slip hours at the end of PA4, and used an additional 3 or 4 for the PA5 checkpoint. So I still haven't gone over my total number of slip hours.

In general, for this assignment I tried to match the reference-coolc as much as possible.
Aside from temporary variables and the occasional optimization the reference-coolc, I mostly matched the reference-coolc.

Most of the bookkeeping is done in CgenClassTable, which maintains maps between the classes (CgenNodes) and attributes/methods/class tags. I use these bookkeeped attributes/methods to find out the exact offsets I need to access a method or attribute.

Similarly, I use the fact that CgenClassTable is a SymbolTable, and use the CgenClassTable to maintain scoping (by entering/exiting scopes as appropriate). Temporary variables, like from typcase or let expressions I use as an offset from $fp which I mantain as the "value" in the key-value pair of the identifier to $fp offset.

For new SELF_TYPEs, I lookup the class tag and find the correct protObj/init from the class_objTab.

For my example.cl, I concatenated all the examples from the CooltoJS page, like I usually do. I enumerated the things that each example tested in the actual example.cl. 
In addition, I added my own test which tests complicated dispatch and SELF_TYPE.

The project was really fulfilling, and thank you for a good semester!
